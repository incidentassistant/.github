# Incident Assistant üõ†Ô∏è

## Overview üåê

Incident Assistant is an innovative tool crafted to address the complexities faced by enterprises with extensive Kubernetes (k8s) clusters and multiple git repositories. In the fast-paced world of microservices, a single change can ripple through the system, causing outages that are difficult to diagnose. This project is the beacon in the storm, guiding development teams to the source of the problem, whether it's a code change, a configuration tweak, or something more elusive.

## Problem Statement üö®

The challenge is real: a change is made, and suddenly the production system falters. With a multitude of microservices at play, tracing the issue across teams and regions is overwhelming. Incident Assistant provides a tailored, cost-effective alternative to general-purpose monitoring tools, delivering precise change monitoring and event correlation right within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

## Current Features ‚úÖ

In its current iteration, Incident Assistant boasts the following capabilities:

- **Kubernetes Change Monitoring and Incident Assistant Kubernetes Agent**: This combined feature set offers a powerful solution for real-time monitoring and analysis of changes within the Kubernetes ecosystem. It includes:
  - **Dynamic Resource Watching**: Monitors events across Kubernetes clusters, focusing on the changes that impact production systems.
  - **Event Correlation with gRPC**: Utilizes high-speed gRPC to emit pertinent change events, enabling quick identification of potential issues.
  - **Lifecycle Event Handling**: Tracks and handles events for resource additions, modifications, and deletions, ensuring that all changes are accounted for.
  - **Change Detection Logging**: Captures the differences between states of modified objects, providing clear visibility into what has changed.
  - **Easy Deployment**: Comes with Kubernetes deployment manifests for a hassle-free setup process, allowing teams to integrate Incident Assistant quickly into their existing workflows.


## Future Vision üîÆ

The roadmap for Incident Assistant is ambitious, with plans to transform it into a leading open-source solution for automated root cause analysis in intricate microservices landscapes. Upcoming features include:

- **Service Dependency Graph**: A tool to map out and comprehend the complex web of microservices, aiding in pinpointing incident origins.
- **Causality Graph**: An analytical feature that connects the dots between events and anomalies, revealing the underlying causes of incidents.
- **Event Correlation**: Enhanced algorithms for smart event and anomaly correlation, streamlining the incident detection process.
- **Root Cause Ranking Algorithm**: An innovative algorithm designed to prioritize incidents based on impact, focusing efforts where they're needed most.

The ultimate goal is to create a system that dynamically constructs a causality tree, pinpointing the root cause of issues automatically.
